							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>The Nicene Creed is a statement of the orthodox faith of the early Christian church, in opposition to certain heresies, especially Arianism. These heresies concerned the doctrine of the Trinity and of the person of Christ and were refuted at the Council of Nicea (AD 325) and formulated in a creed. What we now call the Nicene Creed is not the one formulated by the Council of Nicea but rather one modified by the Council of Constantinople (AD 381) and finally ratified by the church at the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451). Both the Eastern and the Western church confess the truth of the Nicene Creed, although with one important difference. The Western church included the phrase &ldquo;and the Son&rdquo; (known as the Filioque) in the article on the procession of the Holy Spirit, a phrase which to this day is repudiated by the Eastern church.</p>
							<h3>Nicene Creed</h3>
							<p class="hanging">
								I believe in one God,<br>
									the Father Almighty,<br>
									Maker of heaven and earth,<br>
									and of all things visible and invisible.
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								And in one Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
									the only begotten Son of God,<br>
									begotten of the Father before all worlds;<br>
									God of God,<br>
									Light of Light,<br>
									very God of very God;<br>
									begotten, not made,<br>
									being of one substance with the Father,<br>
									by whom all things were made.
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
									Who, for us men and for our salvation,<br>
										came down from heaven,<br>
										and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary,<br>
										and was made man;<br>
										and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate;<br>
										he suffered and was buried;<br>
										and the third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures;<br>
										and ascended into heaven,<br>
										and sits at the right hand of the Father;<br>
										and he shall come again, with glory,<br>
										to judge the living and the dead;<br>
										whose kingdom shall have no end.
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								And I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
									the Lord and giver of life;<br>
									who proceeds from the Father and the Son;<br>
									who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified;<br>
									who spoke by the prophets.
							</p>
							<p class="hanging">
								And I believe one holy catholic<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and apostolic church.<br>
									I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins;<br>
									and I look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
									and the life of the world to come.
							</p>
							<p>
								Amen.
