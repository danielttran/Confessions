								<h3>Preface</h3>
								<p>I am persuaded that the use of a good Catechism in all our families will be a great safeguard against the increasing errors
									of the times, and therefore I have compiled this little manual from the Westminster Assembly&rsquo;s and Baptist Catechisms,
									for the use of my own church and congregation. Those who use it in their families or classes must labour to explain the
									sense; but the words should be carefully learned by heart, for they will be understood better as years pass.
									<br> May the Lord bless my dear friends and their families evermore, is the prayer of their loving Pastor.</p>
